What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It creates a .git folder that keeps all the files neccesary for tracking
    your local changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area lets you differentiate between what you're working, what
    you want to add to the repository, and what is already in the repository.
