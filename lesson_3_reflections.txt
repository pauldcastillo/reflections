When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others or to store code outside of your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be changes on the remote repository you don't want on your
    branch yet. Although you shouldn't really work on master.
