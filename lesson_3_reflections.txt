When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others or to store code outside of your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be changes on the remote repository you don't want on your
    branch yet. Although you shouldn't really work on master.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are copies of repositories you want to edit without changing the
    original, usually one you don't have authorization to edit. Clones are
    copies of repositories you put on your machine to make edits to for later
    merging with the main repository. Branches are copies of repository made
    locally (though not necessarily on your own machine, could be GitHub) for
    merging later.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can compare your branch to the state of the remote repository.
